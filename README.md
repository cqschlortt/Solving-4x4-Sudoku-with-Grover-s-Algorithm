# Solving-4x4-Sudoku-with-Grover-s-Algorithm
Using qiskit, we solve a 4x4 sudoku puzzle by implementing Grover's Algorithm.  The code includes the creation of a diffuser and two oracles, one which solves a true sudoku (but requires too much computing power for hard puzzles) and one which actually solves Latin Squares puzzles, but allows for more empty cells.
